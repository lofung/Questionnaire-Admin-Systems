HOW TO START THE SERVER
-----------------------------------------

The frontend react side are all built.

You may see the project at:
(1) https://questionnaire-admin-systems-fun.onrender.com/
Heroku has stopped their free tier service and now it is deployed at Render.

(2) Use localhost. Run at the root (where server.js is) with 

npm run server

What loads up at the root (localhost:5000 or heroku) would be the frontend for students. The backend for admins is "hidden" at the top left hand corner in a hyperlink.

Currenly, no authentication system has been put up.

------------------------------------------
Database structure
------------------------------------------

The online database of PostgreSQL can be accessed at 

https://www.elephantsql.com/
Login name: 
Password: 

The base database with all the questionnaire information can be accessed at

SELECT * FROM "public"."questionnaire_scheme" LIMIT 100

For every questionnaire, there would be a database built with their token when the questionnaire template is submitted to the database. And hence all the answerse can be submitted with

SELECT * FROM "public"."(TOKEN)" LIMIT 100
SELECT * FROM "public"."oc7qsp4f" LIMIT 100 (for example)

The sub-databases with the token name currently cannot be deleted. (Would be planned carefully)

Only data lines on the main database "questionnaire_scheme" can be deleted in the admin pages.

APIs and other comments
------------------------------------------

Those should be self-explainatory. Comments are mostly sticked into respective parts of the source code.

Remarks	
------------------------------------------

All the bugs and 'wishes' are in the seperate README of README current bugs and wishes.txt

The front end design is not put up yet. However, the vanilla pages should be mostly functional.

Frontend designs have been given up at this stage since it could take a few weeks to develop a good design. However, those designs are mostly cosmetic and would not interfere into most usages.

There are some quality-of-life(QOL) front end designs that could be made. For example

Progress steps: https://lofung.github.io/40_02_progress_steps/ ((DONE))
Seperating choices (MC): https://lofung.github.io/40_13_random_choice_UI/  ((DONE))
